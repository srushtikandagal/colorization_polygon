# Ayna ML Assignment Report: UNet for Polygon Colorization

## Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation and evaluation of a conditional UNet model for polygon colorization. The model successfully learns to generate colored polygon images from input polygon outlines and color specifications, achieving good visual quality and quantitative performance metrics.

## Model Architecture

### UNet Design
The implemented UNet follows the classic encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections:

**Encoder Path:**
- Input: 3-channel polygon image (128x128)
- Encoder blocks: 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 1024 channels
- Each block: MaxPool2d + DoubleConv (Conv2d + BatchNorm + ReLU)

**Decoder Path:**
- Decoder blocks: 1024 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 channels
- Each block: Upsample + Skip connection + DoubleConv
- Output: 3-channel colored image (128x128)

**Key Architectural Choices:**

1. **Color Conditioning**: Color information is embedded as 64-dimensional vectors and injected at multiple scales throughout the network using `ColorInjection` modules.

2. **Skip Connections**: Essential for preserving spatial information and polygon boundaries during upsampling.

3. **Batch Normalization**: Improves training stability and convergence speed.

4. **Bilinear Upsampling**: Used instead of transposed convolutions for smoother outputs.

### Conditioning Strategy
- Color names are embedded into 64-dimensional vectors
- Color embeddings are projected to match feature dimensions at each scale
- Spatial injection via concatenation and 1x1 convolution
- This approach allows the model to learn color-specific features effectively

## Hyperparameters

### Final Settings (After Ablation Studies)

**Model Parameters:**
- Image size: 128x128
- Color embedding dimension: 64
- Number of colors: 10 (red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, brown, black, white)
- Bilinear upsampling: True

**Training Parameters:**
- Learning rate: 1e-4 (with cosine annealing)
- Batch size: 16
- Epochs: 100
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Weight decay: 1e-4
- Loss function: Combined L1 + SSIM (weights: 0.5 each)

**Data Augmentation:**
- Horizontal flip: p=0.5
- Rotation: ±30 degrees, p=0.5
- Brightness/contrast adjustment: p=0.2
- Image normalization: ImageNet stats

### Hyperparameter Ablation Studies

**Learning Rate:**
- Tried: 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5
- Result: 1e-4 provided best convergence
- Higher rates caused instability, lower rates converged too slowly

**Loss Function:**
- Tried: MSE, L1, SSIM, Combined L1+SSIM
- Result: Combined L1+SSIM (0.5 each) gave best perceptual quality
- MSE alone produced blurry outputs
- SSIM alone struggled with color accuracy

**Batch Size:**
- Tried: 8, 16, 32
- Result: 16 provided good balance of memory usage and training stability
- 32 caused memory issues on T4 GPU
- 8 was too small for stable batch normalization

**Color Embedding Dimension:**
- Tried: 32, 64, 128
- Result: 64 provided sufficient expressiveness without overfitting
- 32 was insufficient for complex color relationships
- 128 showed no improvement over 64

## Training Dynamics

### Loss Curves
- **Training Loss**: Started at ~0.15, converged to ~0.02
- **Validation Loss**: Started at ~0.18, converged to ~0.025
- **Convergence**: Achieved around epoch 50-60
- **Overfitting**: Minimal, validation loss closely tracked training loss

### Metrics Evolution
- **PSNR**: Improved from ~15dB to ~25dB
- **L1 Loss**: Decreased from ~0.15 to ~0.02
- **SSIM**: Improved from ~0.3 to ~0.85

### Qualitative Trends
1. **Early Training (Epochs 1-20)**: Model learned basic polygon recognition
2. **Mid Training (Epochs 20-50)**: Improved color application and boundary preservation
3. **Late Training (Epochs 50-100)**: Fine-tuned details and improved consistency

### Typical Failure Modes

**Early Training:**
- Incorrect color application (wrong colors)
- Blurry polygon boundaries
- Incomplete polygon filling

**Mid Training:**
- Color bleeding outside polygon boundaries
- Inconsistent color intensity
- Artifacts at polygon corners

**Late Training:**
- Minor color variations within polygons
- Slight boundary blurring
- Occasional color mixing at edges

### Fixes Attempted

1. **Color Bleeding**: Added stronger boundary preservation through skip connections
2. **Blurry Outputs**: Switched from MSE to L1+SSIM loss
3. **Training Instability**: Added gradient clipping and reduced learning rate
4. **Overfitting**: Increased data augmentation and added weight decay
5. **Color Inconsistency**: Improved color injection mechanism with better normalization

## Key Learnings
